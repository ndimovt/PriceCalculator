# PriceCalculator
In this project i am using MongoDB for the very first time.
Idea behind this project is to use the program as price tracking mechanism for prices of agriculture products throught the years starting from 2022
You can add new products to DB, create new collections for the new years,calculate price for given product for a given year
and you can get all product/price info for a selected year
